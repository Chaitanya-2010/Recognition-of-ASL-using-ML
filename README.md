# Recognition-of-ASL-using-ML
Sign language is the most expressive way for communication between hearing impaired  people, where information is majorly conveyed through the hand/arm gestures. Several Hand gesture recognition methods already exist and most of them are based on Hidden Markov Models, Fuzzy Logic, NeuralNetworks, etc. Even  though most of the methods are extremely effective the computation cost of these methods are high. In order to overcome this, we have developed an alternative method to recognize American sign language with the help of hand gestures.
The process or the execution of this model is:
The ASL symbol is shown and then the image is captured.
After capturing the image, the image pre-processing is carried out.
The image is preprocessed and further passed to region extraction and after that feature extraction is performed.
After feature extraction, feature matching is carried out and after that pattern recognition is performed.
Atlast the ASL alphabet is predicted.
